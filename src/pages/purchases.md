## Product Recommendations

**\*Disclaimer**: These are mostly products that either I or friends have used, buy at your own judgement\*

1. **I am not used to using toilet paper, is there a way to use a jet spray/bidet?**

   - You can install a bidet in Grad Housing and usually does not require any sort of special tooling to install
   - [This is the one I personally use](https://amzn.to/3YmXCWQ) and can say is pretty good.
   - You can also get [portable ones for travel](https://amzn.to/3YqLWmc)

2. **Is the water in San Diego safe to drink? I have heard of Brisa Filters, are they any good?**

   - The water is safe to drink, however has a pretty bad taste so most people get a Brita Pitcher
   - [This is](https://amzn.to/3YlwVSw) the version most people use for personal use.
   - If you want a [common one](https://amzn.to/3YruxtA) for the entire house.

3. **Do I need to change the filter? Where do I get them?**

   - You can purchase the [refills on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Brita-35503-Standard-Replacement-Filters/dp/B00004SU18)

4. **I need a surge protector, what do you recommend?**

   - [Tripp Lite](https://amzn.to/45bm4fW) is prety well reputed and I have used their products, but is slightly higher priced
   - [Phillips](https://amzn.to/44TSBrt) if you are on a tigher budget

5. **I need a mattress for my house, what do you recommend?**

   - You need to first pick a size, Twin is the size for personal use, you can get a full size if you want to share or roll around a lot
   - [Zinus makes good quality beds](https://amzn.to/47lm0Mv) for those on a budget
   - [LinenSpa is another brand](https://amzn.to/3QteNV0) I've seen people use. Just get whatever is cheaper.

6. **Do I need a bed frame?**

   - They are pretty useful to stash your bags under.
   - [Amazon Basics](https://amzn.to/458NKCw) makes some decent ones

7. **What about a desk and chair?**
   - Walmart in particular has a couple of cheap offerings as long as you're fine with a smaller one.
   - If you just want to chill with a straight forward offering from Amazon that you can just get at home then I would say go for [something like this](https://amzn.to/3rSvM8G) and [this](https://amzn.to/45eU1fU)
   - However, this is a very personal preference so get what you like the best IMO.
