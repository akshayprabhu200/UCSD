### Before Landing Checklist:

These are some recommendations for things you'll want to order _before_ you land. **The mailroom will hold these items and provide a large cart to transport everything. There's also a lift, so no need to worry about weight!** I've provided more detailed explanations below, but here's the short version:

1. [Get Prime! Make sure to sign up for Student Prime before you order](https://amzn.to/3SKpjHs)
2. You'll need to sleep on the night you arrive - [Grab a mattress](https://amzn.to/3AjHsFU), [a mattress protector](https://amzn.to/46CQcmF) (to prevent damage), [some fitted sheets](https://amzn.to/3LYbnFY), and [a pillow or two](https://amzn.to/4cke6Vg)
3. Grab toilet supplies: either [toilet paper (avoid single-ply)](https://amzn.to/3SK58cC) or get a [bidet AKA a jetspray](https://amzn.to/3YmXCWQ) <- This one works in HDH Grad Housing
4. Some [body wash](https://amzn.to/4fIsFVx) and [face wash](https://amzn.to/4fG8eZ3) if you didn't bring any
5. For skincare, you'll definitely want to grab some [sunscreen - this is a cheap spray-on option](https://amzn.to/3WHqLeR)
6. Get some [dish soap](https://amzn.to/3WCo4vj), [scotch brite sponges](https://amzn.to/4fxXWuh), and maybe [kitchen paper towels](https://amzn.to/3SK5ujF)
7. Shower curtains aren't standard in HDH housing, [so you might need one](https://amzn.to/4deF4Pa)
8. You'll need [trash bags unless your house already has some](https://amzn.to/3WAbL2u)
9. [You definitely want a Brita filter](https://amzn.to/4dDACt7) because honestly, the water isn't great
10. If you want to hang stuff, definitely get these [3M command strips](https://amzn.to/46JP0hq) - they genuinely support heavy loads like jeans and peel off without causing _too much_ damage
11. A [laundry basket is also a solid pickup](https://amzn.to/3M102oI) along with [some Tide pods](https://amzn.to/3WAbFYG)
12. Some folks [might want a closet organizer - there are no shelves!](https://amzn.to/3M1UZEK)

### Electronics

1. **I need a surge protector, what do you recommend?**

   - [Tripp Lite](https://amzn.to/45bm4fW) is pretty well-reputed and I've used their products, but they're slightly higher priced
   - [Phillips](https://amzn.to/44TSBrt) if you're on a tighter budget

2. **I'm planning to purchase a laptop - would I need a GPU? Should I go for Windows or Mac? What if I plan to do ML?**

    - The choice between Mac and Windows heavily depends on what courses you plan to take. If your course requires specific Windows-only or Mac-only software, then your choice is pretty clear (unless you want to gamble with Parallels, Wine, or a Dual Boot)
    - If you're a gamer, chances are you'll be stuck with Windows, as the gaming experience on Mac is incredibly poor
    - If you're worried about training large ML models, _usually_ if this is part of a course, you can ask your professor for access to [UCSD Datahub](https://datahub.ucsd.edu/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F). If you work for a lab, then the lab will typically have their own servers or access to someone else's that you'll be granted access to in most cases

3. **Recommend some laptops to me**

    - The ThinkPad lineup is a solid bet if you want build quality but don't particularly care about gaming or a GPU. I've personally used the E and T series lineup extensively over the years and would recommend something like the [Lenovo ThinkPad E16](https://amzn.to/4fHD57y)
    - If you're more inclined toward gaming, the [MSI Thin GF63](https://amzn.to/4d8NTdn) would be a decent bet, or something from the [ASUS TUF Gaming series like the A15](https://amzn.to/46IDEtP)
    - You can't go wrong with the MacBook Air or Pro depending on your budget - this is my current daily driver

4. **How do I buy a MacBook? Are there any Black Friday deals?**

    - Apple almost never offers Black Friday deals for their mainline products such as MacBooks, iPhones, etc. Third-party sellers such as Best Buy, Amazon, etc., do. For example, at the time of writing this article, [the second-generation Apple AirPod Pros are on sale for $199](https://amzn.to/47unoN3) instead of the $250 MSRP
    - Apple does offer education discounts year-round for iPads and MacBooks (note that iPhones are NOT included in education pricing)
    - Right before fall, Apple also provides bonuses such as gift cards, AirPods, etc., for devices purchased through the education store. Usually, that's the best time to purchase Apple products

5. **I want to iron my clothes, anything you would recommend?**

    - For ironing clothes, [Black and Decker](https://amzn.to/44dXFpn) makes a cheap iron you could try out

### Furniture

1. **I need a mattress for my house, what do you recommend?**

   - First, pick a size: Twin is for personal use, but you can get a full size if you want to share or roll around a lot
   - [Zinus makes good quality beds](https://amzn.to/47lm0Mv) for those on a budget
   - [LinenSpa is another brand](https://amzn.to/3QteNV0) I've seen people use. Just get whatever is cheaper!

2. **Do I need a bed frame?**

   - They're pretty useful for stashing your bags underneath
   - [Amazon Basics](https://amzn.to/458NKCw) makes some decent ones

3. **What about a desk and chair?**

   - Walmart in particular has a couple of cheap offerings if you're fine with a smaller desk
   - If you just want a straightforward option from Amazon that you can get delivered, then I'd go for [something like this desk](https://amzn.to/3rSvM8G) and [this chair](https://amzn.to/45eU1fU). If you want a fancier [chair, I've used this one before and can confirm it's decent](https://amzn.to/3QZ7wMP)
   - However, this is very much personal preference, so get what you like best!

4. **Do I need to bring a comforter or blanket?**

    - A thin blanket from India might be worth bringing, but for thicker-styled comforters, you can get some cheap ones here
    - Usually store brand ones like [Amazon Basic's Comforters](https://amzn.to/3YD6wj5) or the equivalents from Target or Walmart are good

### Household Recommendations

1. **I'm not used to using toilet paper, is there a way to use a jet spray/bidet?**

   - You can install a bidet in Grad Housing, and it usually doesn't require any special tools
   - [This is the one I personally use](https://amzn.to/3YmXCWQ) and can say is pretty good
   - You can also get [portable ones for travel](https://amzn.to/3YqLWmc)

2. **Is the water in San Diego safe to drink? I've heard of Brita Filters, are they any good?**

   - The water is safe to drink but has a pretty bad taste, so most people get a Brita pitcher
   - [This version](https://amzn.to/3YlwVSw) is what most people use for personal use
   - If you want [a larger one](https://amzn.to/3YruxtA) for the entire house

3. **Do I need to change the filter? Where do I get them?**

   - You can purchase the [refills on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Brita-35503-Standard-Replacement-Filters/dp/B00004SU18)

4. **Any day-to-day purchases to think about?**

   - Consider things like [toilet paper](https://amzn.to/3qqgqYO), [sunscreen](https://amzn.to/47mgzNr) (yes, it's sunny here, even during winter!), [paper towels](https://amzn.to/3OMbYge), [body wash](https://amzn.to/3Qw2y9W), [dish soap](https://amzn.to/3KA9rU5), etc.
   - Store brand versions are usually cheaper - each store has their own in-house brands like Target's Room Essentials or Ralph's Private Selection, which offer similar quality at lower prices

5. **Is there any cough syrup/other OTC medication that people tend to get?**

   - _Disclaimer: Not medical advice! These are over-the-counter medications that could possibly interact with other medications. Check with your doctor/healthcare provider and read any relevant disclosures._
   - A popular choice for cough syrup is the [DayQuil and NyQuil combination](https://amzn.to/453jvwP)
   - Paracetamol in the US is sold under the generic name acetaminophen or more commonly as [Tylenol](https://amzn.to/3DSS39j)
   - Ibuprofen is available under either the brand name [Advil](https://amzn.to/3KxVC8B) or as [generic store brand tablets](https://amzn.to/3KzKd8f) from Amazon and other stores

### Kitchen 

1. **I've heard about Instant Pots, are they any good?**

    - Yeah, Instant Pots are super useful - they have timer functions to cook your food for a fixed amount of time. After cooking, they'll even keep your food warm for 10 hours!
    - If you're forgetful like me, they even have burn protection - if your food might burn, it just stops and alerts you to add more water
    - You can buy the [3-quart version](https://amzn.to/3KAsspe) if you're cooking for yourself (and maybe one friend) or the [6-quart version](https://amzn.to/44UDBcJ) if you want to cook for multiple people at once

2. **What's the easiest way to cook rice, momos, etc.?**

    - Get a rice cooker - [Black and Decker](https://amzn.to/3KApeSB) and [Aroma](https://amzn.to/3QAb2wS) have decent offerings

3. **Any recommendations for mixers/blenders?**

    - US blenders are not comparable to Indian "mixies," so if you plan to make dosa batter from scratch or something similar, it will either be impossible or take a lot of time and effort
    - Typically, people get something like this: [Magic Bullet Blender](https://amzn.to/3DU4FwV)
    - There's a [<$20 version available from Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Mainstays-Single-Serve-Blender-16-oz-Black-with-one-Travel-Lid/929063007?from=%2Fsearch) that's also decent

4. **How does the laundry system work in the US? What kind of detergent do we need?**

    - Unlike India where you might use laundry detergent powder, here it's far more common to use either pods or liquid. (Remember the infamous "Tide Pod Challenge"? Yeah, those pods!)
    - A common choice is one of the [Tide Pods series of detergents](https://amzn.to/47xrunv). It's also available with variations like [a collaboration with Downy](https://amzn.to/44aMttF) or [the one with Febreze](https://amzn.to/45khBYM)
    - Bonus: You might want to use dryer sheets such as [Downy](https://amzn.to/3s62PpT) or [Bounce](https://amzn.to/459eyCX)

5. **Would I need a microwave?**

    - Residents of unfurnished housing such as South and Central Mesa, Nuevo East, etc., would need to purchase a microwave as they only come with a conventional oven
    - Farberware has a few good options [including this one](https://amzn.to/3qre6AZ) and [this one](https://amzn.to/44f6dfN) for under $75 at the time of writing

6. **Do houses come with a trash can? How is garbage handled?**

    - Houses do not come with a trash can. I'd highly recommend checking out Target - they usually have good deals during the back-to-school season on items like this
    - Depending on the size of your can, purchase garbage bags such as these [13-gallon ones](https://amzn.to/3sbfZSF) or these [30-gallon ones](https://amzn.to/3qyioX1)
