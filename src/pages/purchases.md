1. **I am not used to using toilet paper, is there a way to use a jet spray/bidet?**

   - You can install a bidet in Grad Housing and usually does not require any sort of special tooling to install
   - [This is the one I personally use](https://amzn.to/3YmXCWQ) and can say is pretty good.
   - You can also get [portable ones for travel](https://amzn.to/3YqLWmc)

2. **Is the water in San Diego safe to drink? I have heard of Brita Filters, are they any good?**

   - The water is safe to drink, however has a pretty bad taste so most people get a Brita Pitcher
   - [This is](https://amzn.to/3YlwVSw) the version most people use for personal use.
   - If you want a [common one](https://amzn.to/3YruxtA) for the entire house.

3. **Do I need to change the filter? Where do I get them?**

   - You can purchase the [refills on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Brita-35503-Standard-Replacement-Filters/dp/B00004SU18)

4. **I need a surge protector, what do you recommend?**

   - [Tripp Lite](https://amzn.to/45bm4fW) is prety well reputed and I have used their products, but is slightly higher priced
   - [Phillips](https://amzn.to/44TSBrt) if you are on a tigher budget

5. **I need a mattress for my house, what do you recommend?**

   - You need to first pick a size, Twin is the size for personal use, you can get a full size if you want to share or roll around a lot
   - [Zinus makes good quality beds](https://amzn.to/47lm0Mv) for those on a budget
   - [LinenSpa is another brand](https://amzn.to/3QteNV0) I've seen people use. Just get whatever is cheaper.

6. **Do I need a bed frame?**

   - They are pretty useful to stash your bags under.
   - [Amazon Basics](https://amzn.to/458NKCw) makes some decent ones

7. **What about a desk and chair?**

   - Walmart in particular has a couple of cheap offerings as long as you're fine with a smaller one.
   - If you just want to chill with a straight forward offering from Amazon that you can just get at home then I would say go for [something like this](https://amzn.to/3rSvM8G) and [this](https://amzn.to/45eU1fU)
   - However, this is a very personal preference so get what you like the best IMO.

8. **Any day to day purchases to think about?**

   - You can consider things like [toilet paper](https://amzn.to/3qqgqYO), [sunscreen](https://amzn.to/47mgzNr) (yes, it's sunny here, even during the winter), [kitchen rolls](https://amzn.to/3OMbYge), [body wash](https://amzn.to/3Qw2y9W), [dish soap](https://amzn.to/3KA9rU5), etc.
   - Store brand versions of the above are usually cheaper, usually each store has their own in house brands like Target's Room Essentials or Ralph's Private selection which will have cheaper but similar quality versions of all of the above brands.

9. **Is there any cough syrup/other OTC medication that people tend to get?**

   - _Disclaimer: Not medical advice, these are over the counter medications and could possibly interact with your other medication. Check with your doctor/healthcare provider and read any relevant disclosures they have._
   - A popular choice for cough syrup is the [DayQuil and Nyquil combination](https://amzn.to/453jvwP).
   - Paracetamol in the the US is sold under the generic name acetaminophen or more commonly as [Tylenol](https://amzn.to/3DSS39j)
   - Ibuprofen is also available under either brand name [Advil](https://amzn.to/3KxVC8B) or as [generic store brand tablets as Ibuprofen](https://amzn.to/3KzKd8f) from Amazon and other stores.

10. **I have heard about Instant Pots, are they any good?**

    - Yeah, Instant Pots are pretty useful - they have timer functions to cook your food a fixed amount of time. After cooking the thing will even keep your food warm for 10 hours.
    - If you're forgetful like I am, then it even has burnt protections, if the item might burn it just stops and alerts you to add more water.
    - You can buy the [3 quart version](https://amzn.to/3KAsspe) if you want to cook for yourself (and maybe one friend) and [6 quart version](https://amzn.to/44UDBcJ) if you want to cook for multiple people at once.

11. **What's the easiest way to cook rice, momos, etc?**

    - Get a rice cooker - [Black and Decker](https://amzn.to/3KApeSB) and [Aroma](https://amzn.to/3QAb2wS) have decent offerings

12. **Any recommendations for mixers/blenders?**

    - US blenders are not comparable to Indian "mixies", so if you plan to make like dosa batter from scratch or something it wil either be not possible or take a lot of time and effort.
    - Typically people get something that looks like this: [Magic Bullet Blender](https://amzn.to/3DU4FwV)
    - There's a [<$20 version available which I got from Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Mainstays-Single-Serve-Blender-16-oz-Black-with-one-Travel-Lid/929063007?from=%2Fsearch), that's also decent.

13. Do I need to bring a comforter or blanket?

    - A thin blanket from India might be worth bringing but for the thicker styled comforters you can get some cheap ones here
    - Usually store brand ones like [Amazon Basic's Comforters](https://amzn.to/3YD6wj5) or the equivalents from Target or Walmart are good

14. How does the laundry system work in the US? What kind of detergent do we need?

    - Unlike India where you use something like laundry detergent powder, here it is far more common to use either pods or liquid. Throwback to the "Tide Pod Challenge" if anyone remembers that.
    - A common choice is one of the [Tide Pods series of detegents](https://amzn.to/47xrunv). It's also available with flavours such as [a collaboration with Downy](https://amzn.to/44aMttF) or [the one with Febreeze](https://amzn.to/45khBYM).
    - Bonus: You might want to use a dryer sheet such as [Downy](https://amzn.to/3s62PpT) or [Bounce](https://amzn.to/459eyCX)

15. I am planning to purchase a laptop - would I need a GPU? Should I go for Windows or Mac? What if I plan to do ML?

    - The choice of Macs and Windows, heavily depends on what kind of courses you want to take. If your course requires a specific Windows or Mac only software then you have no choice but to get that unless you plan to gamble with Parallels, Wine or a Dual Boot.
    - If you are a gamer, chances are you will be stuck with Windows due to the overall gaming experience on Mac being incredibly poor.
    - If you are worried about training large ML models _usually_ if this is a part of a course you can request to prof to give you access to [UCSD Datahub](https://datahub.ucsd.edu/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F) or if you work for a lab, then usually the lab will have their own servers or access to some one else's which you will be granted access to in most cases.

16. How do I buy a Macbook? Are there any Black Friday deals?

    - Apple almost never does any sort of Black Friday deals for their mainline products such as Macbooks, iPhones, etc. Third party sellers such as Best Buy, Amazon, etc do. For example, at the time of writing this article t[he second generation Apple Airpod Pros are sale for $199](https://amzn.to/47unoN3) instead of the $250 MSRP.
    - Apple, however, if purchased directly through them does education discounts year round for iPads and Macbooks (note that iPhones are NOT a part of education pricing).
    - Right before fall, Apple also provides some sort of bonus such as giftcards, airpods, etc for devices purchased through the education store. Usually that is the best time to purchase Apple products.

17. I want to iron my clothes, anything you would recommend?

    - For ironing clothes, [Black and Decker](https://amzn.to/44dXFpn) makes a cheap iron you could try out.

18. Would I need a microwave?

    - Residents of unfurnished housing such as South and Central Mesa, Nuevo East, etc would need to purchase a microwave as they only come with a convectional oven.
    - Faberware has a few good options [including this](https://amzn.to/3qre6AZ) and [this one](https://amzn.to/44f6dfN) for under $75 at the time of writing this.

19. Do houses come with a trashcan? How is garbage handled?

    - Houses do not come with a trash can, I'd highly recommend checking out Target, they usually have a good deal during the back to school season on stuff like this.
    - Depending on the size of your can purchase a garbage bag such as this [13 gallon one](https://amzn.to/3sbfZSF) or this [30 gallon one](https://amzn.to/3qyioX1).
