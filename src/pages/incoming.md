_**Disclaimer**: The information is the best of my knowledge, please confirm everything as far as possible at the time of your arrival_

## Before Arriving in the US

1. **Book a bank appointment!**

   - [More on banking in the banking section](#banking-in-the-us)
   - Banks in the US will NOT entertain you without an appointment. Book an appointment for this while you are in India. This time is peak season to the point the Chase Nobel Drive branch calls in twelve additional bankers from other branches to handle the demand.
   - [The link to book an appointment for Chase](https://www.chase.com/meeting-scheduler/getstarted)
   - [The link to book an appointment for Bank of America](https://secure.bankofamerica.com/secure-mycommunications/public/appointments/)

2. **Prepare for the learners license test**

   - A DL in the US is a very useful document to have, you will need to clear a DL learners license test.
   - Please [read the entire handbook a couple of times](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/california-driver-handbook-pdf/)

3. **Travel Insurance**

   - Strictly speaking this is optional, however, Fall Quarter coverage for UCShip doesnt start till the start of the quarter so it is highly recommended to have some cover for your health.
   - Make sure to read about the coverage, some plans have incredibly poor travel coverage

4. **Prearrival Purchases**

   - For people landing early, or at odd times if you need certain "small" items as soon as you land, there's things called Amazon Lockers. These are open 24/7 and if you order to them, Amazon sends you a code, you enter the code on the Kiosk and it automatically opens the locker with your item which you can grab. Nearest ones: Nuevo East - Furniture, in the Exchange building; NW - Ruckus, under Viento; MN - Convex, in the parking lot near HDH's office; It will be available on the checkout page.
   - You may want to order certain things for day one itself, as shipping in the US take a lot more time than India so make sure to order some of this stuff in advance. You can sign up for [Amazon Prime as a student for free for six months](https://amzn.to/3QtUOVV). Make sure to take advantage of that
   - Some stuff you may want to order in advance before arriving here depending on your situation are: [bidet/jet spray](https://amzn.to/3YmXCWQ), [toilet paper](https://amzn.to/3qqgqYO), [sunscreen](https://amzn.to/47mgzNr) (yes, it's sunny here, even during the winter), [kitchen rolls](https://amzn.to/3OMbYge), [body wash](https://amzn.to/3Qw2y9W), [dish soap](https://amzn.to/3KA9rU5), etc. Other potential purhcases there on the [purchases page](https://ucsd.akshayprabhu.dev/purchases/)

## Arrival in the US

1. **How do I get from the San Diego Airport to the UCSD Campus?**

   - **Uber** - The easiest option to get from airport to the campus is obviously and Uber or a Lyft (Feel free to use the following referral codes: [click here for Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/i/AKSHAY37803?utm_medium=p2pi_iacc) or enter AKSHAY37803 for a discount on your rides. Uber doesn't have such a bonus currently). Naturally, this is a pricier option, regular ones start at around $20 and an XL during peak hours can almost reach $50.
   - **Airport Shuttle** - This is available during the daylight hours and will take you to the Old Town Transit Centre. From there you can take the UCSD Blue Line Trolley to UTC to get to Grad Housing. For Nuevo East, South Mesa and Mesa Nueva residents please get down at Executive Drive and for all other housing please get down at VA Medical Center
   - **Car Rental** - Strongly recommended that you take this option at your own risk as for most international students you will be jet lagged, tired and possibly not used to driving in the US and lastly the legality of driving in the US with an international driver's license is not entirely clear. Strictly for informational purposes, you can rent a car from the airport, there will be rental car companies such as Hertz, Enterprise, etc who will issue you a car for about $49-60 a day, fuel not included.
     of writing this article, fuel is around $5.5 a US gallon.

2. **How do I get from the Los Angeles Airport to the UCSD Campus?**
   - **Uber** - The easiest option to get from airport to the campus is obviously and Uber or a Lyft (Feel free to use the following referral codes: [click here for Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/i/AKSHAY37803?utm_medium=p2pi_iacc) or enter AKSHAY37803 for a discount on your rides. Uber doesn't have such a bonus currently). Naturally, this is a pricier option, regular ones start at around $200 and an XL during peak hours can almost reach $450. It will take around 2 hours to reach San Diego
   - **Flixbus** - US public transportion is not the most reliable, and expect delays. Flixbus is availabe from Cesar E Chavez Ave and you can take an Uber from the airport to the stop. The cost to San Diego is around $20 if you book early. This includes one luggage bag and one carry on. You can purchase more bags for $20 each.
   - **Car Rental** - Strongly recommended that you take this option at your own risk as for most international students you will be jet lagged, tired and possibly not used to driving in the US and lastly the legality of driving in the US with an international driver's license is not entirely clear. Strictly for informational purposes, you can rent a car from the airport, there will be rental car companies such as Hertz, Enterprise, etc who will issue you a car for about $49-60 a day, fuel not included. At the time of writing this aritcle, fuel is around $5.5 a US gallon. This is roughly a 3 hr hour journey (112.2 mi/180 km) via I-405 S and I-5 S.

## Banking in the US

_**Disclaimer**: Not meant to be financial advice, do your own research, banking policies often change, confirming this with the bank staff and their ToS is strongly recommended_

1. **What documents will I need to open a bank account?**

   - You will need your address proof (rental agreement works), passport, visa and I-20.
   - You do NOT need an SSN to open a bank account

2. **Where to open a bank account in the US?**

   - Most students bank at Chase and Bank of America. Both of these are available right beside each other at Nobel Drive. There is also UCU Credit Union available inside price center

3. **I am over 25 and no longer eligible for the free student account what are my options?**

   - **Chase** - The monthly service fees is $12 a month _unless_ you have either $1,500 minimum balance at the end of each day OR you have an oncampus job which provides a direct deposit of $500 each month.
   - **BoFa** - The monthly service fees is $12 a month _unless_ you have either $1,500 minimum balance at the end of each day OR you have an oncampus job which provides a direct deposit of $250 each month.
   - **UCU** - No fees, this is the easiest way option if you are over 25.

4. **Is there any way to get a credit card if I dont have an SSN. What are my options?**

   - **BoFa** - They provide the Customized Cash Rewards for students even without an SSN.
   - **Amex** - This is the best option for those with an Indian credit history as Amex in tie up with some partner will pull your Indian CIBIL and offer you a credit card in the US.
   - **Discover** - They have a special student credit card that they will offer without any sort of

5. **Do I _need_ a credit card?**

   - Yes, fundamentally, credit cards help you manage cashflows, especially since you might be waiting for your paycheck, perhaps a remittance, etc.
   - But what is more critical is, they help you build credit in the US. A credit score in the US can often be a matter of your job prospects, your ability to live in an area, etc.
   - [Employers can request your credit history](https://www.cnbc.com/select/can-employers-see-your-credit-score/) and so can [potential landlords if you plan on renting a house](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/do-you-need-a-credit-score-to-rent-a-house-or-apartment/).
   - A lot of places like gas stations, hotels and rental car places will place holds when you try to use their services. If you have a credit card, this just temporily blocks a part of your usage limit but if you use a debit card this sometimes results in money being actually deducted temporily.
   - Credit cards often offer a large number of points. In the US, credit cards offer a large number of rewards just for shopping in their categories. For example, [Amex offers 6% back on groceries on some of their cards](https://americanexpress.com/en-us/referral/AKSHaP4z4w?XLINK=MYCP)
   - Alternatively, many cards offer a huge range of benefits such as but not limited to - free damage waivers on your rental car, extended warranty on all card purchases, 0% APR periods, lounge access if it's a premium travel card like Chase Sapphire or Amex Platinum, etc.

6. **I see Chase offers a bonus of $100/200 if you open a bank account with a referral? How do I go around claiming the bonus?**

   - Feel [to use mine](https://accounts.chase.com/raf/share/3141596503), if you qualify there's around a bonus of $100 if you open a Student Checking account and $200 if you open a Total Checking Account.
   - To steps to avail the offer are [visit the referral link](https://accounts.chase.com/raf/share/3141596503) and enter your email ID.
   - Chase will send you coupon for the offer which you then read out to the staff member opening your account.

7. **How to receive money in my bank account?**

   - Most banks will provide you with a SWIFT code, this combined with your name, branch address, etc will be how you can recieve money.
   - Most banks will charge $15/16 for incoming wire transfers. _UCU being the acception providing free incoming wires_

8. **How to send money to others in the US?**

   - Zelle is run by banks and the closest the US has to something like IMPS. Works in a similar way where you enter a phone number or email ID to send money.
   - [Venmo is another popular way to send money to people in the US amd they offer you $10 on account creation, if you spend $5 within two weeks of creating an account](https://get.venmo.com/TAS4TM6WmCb). Zelle is slightly less common outside international students, compared to Venmo which is more common with Americans.
   - [PayPal is a popular way to send money in the US to people who you don't quite trust](https://py.pl/2HQ9AX) and in a lot of shady sites paying through PayPal prevents them from getting your card details.

9. **How do I send money to the US?**

   - The most stable option to the remit money to the US remits using wire transfers.
   - Wire transfers have fees in four possible ways:
     - Conversion fees: These are straight forward, a charge to convert the INR to USD
     - Wire Fees from the Indian Bank
     - Forex Markup ie the rate at which INR is converted to USD, may services will use incredibly poor rates
     - Incoming wire transfer fees from your bank in the US
   - You can minimize the first three by using some newer age bank with free international wires and forex such as DBS, DCB, etc (atleast at the time of writing).

10. **How do I pay my tuition and rent?**

- If your fees is being sent by your loan provider and they insist on paying the university directly then Flywire and other offers tied with UCSD are your only possible options.
- If your bank disburses the account to your account OR you are paying the fees yourself then remit the money to your bank account in the US and then use the "E-Check" option to pay your fees. This costs merely 50 cents per transaction and is one of the easiest ways to pay UCSD.

11. **I don't have an SSN, how do I apply for a credit card in the US?**

    - The easiest approaches tend to be open a credit card with the bank you opened an account with. Bank of America tends to do it immediately after opening an account, though Chase might make you wait a few months.
    - If you had an Indian credit history, then you have two other options - firstly if you had an Amex credit card in India, then you you can apply for their Global Program which can help you transition your existing card to the US.
    - Alternative, you can just apply for an Amex card and enter that you dont have an SSN in the application and you will be able to apply using the credit score you had from your home country.

## Transportation within San Diego

1. **How do I travel within San Diego?**

   - Main route of transport is MTS buses and Trollies which would require the use of your "Pronto Pass". This will be activated at the start of the quarter, until then you will need to load money into the pass.

2. **How do I get to Nobel Drive?**
   - **Trolley**: : For Nuevo East, South Mesa, Central Mesa and Mesa Nueva residents please take the trolley at Executive Drive and for all other housing please take the trolley at VA Medical Center. From there you can take the UCSD Blue Line Trolley to San Ysidro to get to Nobel Drive Station.
   - **Buses**: You can also take buses including 101, 202, 41, etc from various stops in and around Grad Housing
   - **Walking**: It's a short 20-25 minute walk to Nobel Drive and usually fairly safe atleast during day light hours. The Nobel drive area itself is fairly well lit up as shops are open till 1 am or so.

## Groceries

1. **Where do most people get their groceries?**

   - **Target** - Target is available on campus, is around a 25 minute walk from grad housing. Alternatively, you can take the Mesa South Shuttle, which takes 15 minutes and you can get down at Mandeville. _Best for: Milk, Eggs_
   - **Ralphs** - Nearest one is in Nobel Drive. You can walk to Nobel Drive, takes around 25 minutes. You can also take the Blue Line (towards San Ysidro). You can also take buses including 101, 30, etc. _Best for: Chicken, Veggies, Fruits, Alcohol_. Make sure to install the app for the the discounts _else you will pay MSRP for most items!_
   - **Trader Joe's** - Nearest one is in Nobel Drive. You can walk to Nobel Drive, takes around 25 minutes. You can also take the Blue Line (towards San Ysidro). You can also take buses including 101, 30, etc. _Best for: Frozen Food, exotic items_

2. **Where do I shop for Indian Groceries?**

   - **Miramar Cash and Carry**
   - **Namaste Plaza**
   - **Akshar Cash and Carry**

3. **These are too far, can I order?**

   - You can order online from most stores through their subscription services such as Ralph's Boost which costs $60 a year
   - Miramar Cash and Carry does home delivery for orders above $125, you can pool your order for this and collect once. _However, prices are 10-20% higher for delivery and there is no student discount_

4. **I have heard about Costco, where is the nearest Costco?**

   - Nearest one is in Morena, however there is no public transportation that goes closeby.
   - Entry needs a membership of atleast $60 a year and the groceries are sold in quantities most students wont use.
   - _Best for: Pricey clothing for cheap, electronics, Brita Filters_

5. **I have heard about Walmart, where is the nearest Walmart?**
   - Nearest one is in Clairemont Mesa. You can take bus 41 and then switch to 43.
   - Alternatively, during the weekends, there is the Grocery Shuttle which will take you to Walmart directly.
6. **I love fish, where do I buy fresh fish?**
   - **99 Ranch Market** - In convoy street, youc an take the aforementioned Grocery Shuttle on weekends which stops right in front of it. Also sells asian groceries such as Boba packets, Ramen, etc.

## State ID and Driving License

1. **What is a State ID and do I need one?**

   - A state ID is simply a document that acts as a proof of your identity. It can used to enter bars, take flights, prove you are a San Diego resident for discounted entry to the Zoo, etc.

2. **What is a REAL ID and how does it differ from the State ID/DL**
   - REAL ID is like a chip based version of the state ID or DL. You can have ONE so you can either get a REAL ID DL or State ID. I would recommend getting the State ID version as it takes time to get a DL
   - You would need to use a REAL ID take domestic flights in the US (otherwise you need to carry your passport).
3. **What is the process to get a state ID and DL**

   - Same common form for both, you can apply for both at the same time. Go to [DMV website](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/dl-id-online-app-edl-44/) and fill out the form
   - You may need to upload some documents such as two forms of address proof (rental agreement, bank account statement print out and utility bills for OMS/Mesa Housing/off campus residents works) along site immigration documents such as passport, visa, etc.
   - You can book an appointment or you can walk in, however the line for walking in will be longer. The nearest DMV is in Clairemont.
   - Carry all documents, wait in line for a token. Provide documents to the staff. If you have signed up for a DL, you will need to clear the MCQ test too, which required 32/40 correct.
   - If you clear the MCQ, you get a learners license and then you can book a behind the wheel test within a year.

4. **Do I need an SSN?**

   - You do not need an SSN to get a state ID or a drivers license.
   - However, in some cases the DMV may request you provide an SSN rejection letter which is a document from the SSA office that states that you are not eligible for an SSN.

5. **How much are the costs?**
   - At the time of writing this article - 35$ for the State ID and 41$ for a class C DL
   - Do note there are extra charges if you pay by card.
6. **How to prepare for the test?**
   - Please [read the entire handbook a couple of times](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/california-driver-handbook-pdf/) for the first part of the test.
   - Practice the DMV route (availabe on youtube) by renting a car.
7. **How to get a car for the behind the wheel test?**

   - You will need to rent a car from a rental car company such as Hertz, Enterprise, etc which needs to insured in your name.
   - Depending on your circumstances you might need someone with a valid California DL with you.

8. **How many attempts do I get?**
   - Three for the MCQ based test and three for the behind the wheel test.

## Social Security Number

1. **Can international students get a social security number?**
   - International students are eligible for a social security number if they have get some form of employment in the US. This can be an on campus job, a TA or GSR position, an internship, etc.
2. **What is the process to get a social security number as TA/GSR?**
   - Download and print your appointment letter from the Academic Affairs portal
   - Contact your hiring department's HR and request for an "offer letter". _This needs to be a WET INK_ letter, which means there's a physical sign on it using a pen.
   - Apply for a support letter from ISPO, this process takes a few business days.
   - Visit an SSA office with the above three letters along with your usual immigration documents. Nearest one to grad housing is in Little Italy (Note: Google Maps recommends Kearny Mesa but this requires two bus changes and is annoying to get to.)

## HDH and Housing Questions

1. **What is the difference between the mailing address and actual address?**

   - This question is mainly pertinent for buildings with a separate mailroom such as the Nuevas.
   - Mailing address is where most if not all mail and parcels should be addressed to. This is the mailing room address where parcels will be collected. USPS delivered letters will put in your house's mailbox.
   - The actual house's address is different and is where you physically live. Doordash, Uber East, Instacart, etc can be addressed to this addressed. _However, this is less reliable for certain buildings which require keycards to enter_

2. **What is the format of the housing address?**

   - For the Nuevas, the address is usually in the format: mailbox number, mailbox building number, Miramar Street, La Jolla, CA 92092
   - For the older Mesas, the address is usually in the format: house number Regents Road, Apt apartment name

3. **Can we switch houses later on?**

   - Yes, fill out the housing application again.

4. **Can we quit before the two year lease period notice is up?**

   - Yes, with one month's notice you can leave

5. **How is garbage and waste disposal handled?**

   - Buildings such as Mesa Nueva, Nuevo East and Nuevo West will have "trash chutes" where you can throw down your garbage bags
   - The rest will have large bins in their area where garbage can be thrown. For both cases, you will have a general landfill bin and a recyclable bin.
   - You will need to purchase a trash can and depending on the size of your can purchase a garbage bag such as this [13 gallon one](https://amzn.to/3sbfZSF) or this [30 gallon one](https://amzn.to/3qyioX1).

6. **Does HDH lend out anything any tools/services?**

   - **Vaccuum Cleaner**: You can borrow a decently sized vaccuum cleaner from HDH by collecting one from the mailrooms or HDH offices. There isn't any strict timeline to return them but they will usually make you sign a document asking for your flat number and PID.
   - **Tool Box**: You can borrow a toolkit with things like spanners from HDH by collecting one from the mailrooms or HDH offices. There isn't any strict timeline to return them but they will usually make you sign a document asking for your flat number and PID.
   - **Carts**: If you want to carry heavy stuff around, HDH provides a large cart which makes it easy to transport beds, mattresses, and other heavy items.

## Career Fairs

1. **How do career fairs work?**

   - Usually companies will come and setup a booth where you can queue up and wait for your turn and talk to the recruiter, current employees or even the hiring manager at times.
   - Generally there isnt any specific thing you can/can't talk about. Naturally, you want to keep it professional and relevant as these are busy individuals but it's your responsibility to make a lasting impression.
   - If you're socially gifted, do your research, etc you may be able to convert that conversation into a future meeting where you can then leverage the connection for a referral. _Do not ask for a referral on the spot, it's considered bad etiquette and advising in general hates that behaviour._

2. **Are we granted a job for sure or is there still uncertainity?**

   - Most companies which come to UCSD career fairs have long histories of hiring from UCSD. So while, there isn't an Indian style campus placements system in place, if a company comes to UCSD, it means they have a favourable impression of our grads, have several alumni working there and will likely favour UCSD grads.
   - Many companies will have a dedicated University Recruiters. These individuals are a point of contact from the company for all students from the university. UCSD usually has a dedicated recruiter (sometimes shared with other UCs such as UCLA and Cal) with major firms. Keep in touch with these folks, as they will push to hire you and can provide you with resources.

3. **So even for campus fairs, we still just apply online?**

   - Usually, yes. However, many companies will have a _special link_ for the career fair itself. And attendees can apply through that and occassionally some companies atleast send an online assessment round to all those who applied through that.
   - Also carry physical copies of your resume which you can drop off. Some companies will reach out to you asking about open positions if you drop a resume.

4. **How do we dress?**

   - I'll defer to CSE's suggestion: "US business casual. You do not need a full suit, but DO NOT show up in dirty clothes, pajamas, sleepwear, or anything too casual. You need to see yourself through the employers’s eyes, and a sloppy image can send the image that you don’t care or want employment and can also be read as arrogance"

## First Week Checklist

- Phone, if needed
- New sim, have a senior collect a mint sim from ispo
- Get I-94 checked in
- New laptop if needed

- Explore SD as well, you will not have the time for a while

## Concluding Thoughts
