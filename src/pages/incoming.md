## Before Arriving in the US

1. **Book a bank appointment!**

   - [More on banking in the banking section](#banking-in-the-us)
   - Banks in the US will NOT assist you without an appointment. Book one while you're still in your home country. Peak season is so busy that the Chase Nobel Drive branch calls in twelve additional bankers from other branches to handle the demand.
   - [The link to book an appointment for Chase](https://www.chase.com/meeting-scheduler/getstarted)
   - [The link to book an appointment for Bank of America](https://secure.bankofamerica.com/secure-mycommunications/public/appointments/)

2. **Prepare for the learner's license test**

   - A driver's license in the US is a very useful document to have. You'll need to pass a learner's license test first.
   - Please [read the entire handbook a couple of times](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/california-driver-handbook-pdf/)

3. **Travel Insurance**

   - Strictly speaking, this is optional. However, Fall Quarter coverage for UCShip doesn't start until the beginning of the quarter, so having some health coverage is highly recommended.
   - Make sure to read about the coverage—some plans have incredibly poor travel benefits.

4. **Pre-arrival Purchases**

   - **[Make sure to sign up for Amazon Student Prime, which is free for six months, before making these orders. Without Prime, orders take a long time to deliver in the US](https://amzn.to/3QtUOVV)**
   - **[If you're spending at Walmart, Target, and other stores, sign up through Rakuten for cashback + $30 on your first purchase](https://www.rakuten.com/r/AKSHAY2473?eeid=28187)**
   - For people landing early or at odd times who need certain "small" items as soon as they land, there are Amazon Lockers available. These are open 24/7—you order to them, Amazon sends you a code, you enter the code on the kiosk, and it automatically opens the locker with your item. Nearest ones: Nuevo East - Furniture, in the Exchange building; NW - Ruckus, under Viento; MN - Convex, in the parking lot near HDH's office. The locker option will be available on the checkout page.
   - You may want to order certain things for day one, as shipping in the US takes more time than in many other countries, so order some essentials in advance.
   - Items you might want to order before arriving (depending on your situation): [bidet/jet spray](https://amzn.to/3YmXCWQ), [toilet paper](https://amzn.to/3qqgqYO), [sunscreen](https://amzn.to/47mgzNr) (yes, it's sunny here, even during winter), [kitchen rolls](https://amzn.to/3OMbYge), [body wash](https://amzn.to/3Qw2y9W), [dish soap](https://amzn.to/3KA9rU5), etc. Other potential purchases are listed on the [purchases page](https://ucsd.akshayprabhu.dev/purchases/).
   - [Make sure to buy a Brita filter as water is NOT the best tasting in San Diego](https://amzn.to/3YlwVSw).

## Arrival in the US

1. **How do I get from the San Diego Airport to the UCSD Campus?**

   - **Uber** - The easiest option to get from the airport to campus is obviously Uber or Lyft (Feel free to use the following referral codes: [click here for Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/i/AKSHAY37803?utm_medium=p2pi_iacc) or enter AKSHAY37803 for a discount on your rides. Uber doesn't have such a bonus currently). Naturally, this is a pricier option; regular rides start at around $20, and an XL during peak hours can reach nearly $50.
   - **Airport Shuttle** - Available during daylight hours, this will take you to the Old Town Transit Centre. From there, you can take the UCSD Blue Line Trolley to UTC to get to Grad Housing. For Nuevo East, South Mesa, and Mesa Nueva residents, get off at Executive Drive. For all other housing, get off at VA Medical Center.
   - **Car Rental** - Strongly recommended that you take this option at your own risk, as most international students will be jet-lagged, tired, and possibly not used to driving in the US. The legality of driving in the US with an international driver's license is not entirely clear. Strictly for informational purposes: you can rent a car from the airport from companies like Hertz, Enterprise, etc., for about $49-60 a day, fuel not included. As of writing, fuel is around $5.5 per US gallon.

2. **How do I get from the Los Angeles Airport to the UCSD Campus?**
   - **Uber** - The easiest option to get from the airport to campus is Uber or Lyft (Feel free to use the following referral codes: [click here for Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/i/AKSHAY37803?utm_medium=p2pi_iacc) or enter AKSHAY37803 for a discount on your rides. Uber doesn't have such a bonus currently). This is quite expensive—regular rides start at around $200, and an XL during peak hours can reach nearly $450. It takes about 2 hours to reach San Diego.
   - **Flixbus** - US public transportation is not the most reliable, so expect delays. Flixbus is available from Cesar E Chavez Ave, and you can take an Uber from the airport to the stop. The fare to San Diego is around $20 if you book early. This includes one luggage bag and one carry-on. You can purchase additional bags for $20 each.
   - **Car Rental** - Strongly recommended that you take this option at your own risk, as most international students will be jet-lagged, tired, and possibly not used to driving in the US. The legality of driving in the US with an international driver's license is not entirely clear. Strictly for informational purposes: you can rent a car from the airport from companies like Hertz, Enterprise, etc., for about $49-60 a day, fuel not included. As of writing, fuel is around $5.5 per US gallon. This is roughly a 3-hour journey (112.2 mi/180 km) via I-405 S and I-5 S.

## Banking in the US

_**Disclaimer**: Not meant to be financial advice. Do your own research, as banking policies often change. Confirming details with bank staff and their Terms of Service is strongly recommended._

1. **What documents will I need to open a bank account?**

   - You will need address proof (rental agreement works), passport, visa, and I-20.
   - You do NOT need an SSN to open a bank account.

2. **Where should I open a bank account in the US?**

   - Most students bank at Chase or Bank of America. Both are located next to each other on Nobel Drive. There's also the UCU Credit Union available inside Price Center.

3. **I am over 25 and no longer eligible for the free student account. What are my options?**

   - **Chase** - The monthly service fee is $12 _unless_ you have either $1,500 minimum balance at the end of each day OR you have an on-campus job that provides a direct deposit of $500 each month.
   - **BoFA** - The monthly service fee is $12 _unless_ you have either $1,500 minimum balance at the end of each day OR you have an on-campus job that provides a direct deposit of $250 each month.
   - **UCU** - No fees! This is the easiest option if you are over 25.

4. **Is there any way to get a credit card if I don't have an SSN? What are my options?**

   - **BoFA** - They provide the Customized Cash Rewards for students even without an SSN.
   - **Amex** - This is the best option for those with an established credit history in their home country, as Amex, in partnership with some providers, will check your home country credit score and offer you a credit card in the US.
   - **Discover** - They have a special student credit card they'll offer without extensive requirements.

5. **Do I _need_ a credit card?**

   - Yes! Fundamentally, credit cards help you manage cash flow, especially since you might be waiting for your paycheck or perhaps a money transfer from home.
   - More critically, they help you build credit in the US. A credit score in the US can impact your job prospects and your ability to live in certain areas.
   - [Employers can request your credit history](https://www.cnbc.com/select/can-employers-see-your-credit-score/), and so can [potential landlords if you plan on renting a house](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/do-you-need-a-credit-score-to-rent-a-house-or-apartment/).
   - Many places like gas stations, hotels, and rental car companies will place holds when you use their services. With a credit card, this just temporarily blocks part of your usage limit, but with a debit card, money might actually be deducted temporarily.
   - Credit cards often offer numerous reward points. In the US, credit cards offer many rewards just for shopping in specific categories. For example, [Amex offers 6% back on groceries on some of their cards](https://americanexpress.com/en-us/referral/AKSHaP4z4w?XLINK=MYCP)
   - Many cards offer a range of benefits such as free damage waivers on rental cars, extended warranty on purchases, 0% APR periods, lounge access if it's a premium travel card like Chase Sapphire or Amex Platinum, and more.

6. **I see Chase offers a bonus of $100/$200 if you open a bank account with a referral. How do I claim this bonus?**

   - Feel [free to use mine](https://accounts.chase.com/raf/share/3141596503). If you qualify, there's a bonus of $100 for opening a Student Checking account and $200 for opening a Total Checking Account.
   - To avail the offer: [visit the referral link](https://accounts.chase.com/raf/share/3141596503) and enter your email ID.
   - Chase will send you a coupon for the offer, which you then read to the staff member opening your account.

7. **How do I receive money in my bank account?**

   - Most banks will provide you with a SWIFT code. This, combined with your name, branch address, etc., is how you can receive money.
   - Most banks charge $15-16 for incoming wire transfers. _UCU is an exception, providing free incoming wires._

8. **How do I send money to others in the US?**

   - Zelle is run by banks and is the closest the US has to something like IMPS. It works similarly—you enter a phone number or email ID to send money.
   - [Venmo is another popular way to send money to people in the US, and they offer you $10 on account creation if you spend $5 within two weeks of creating an account](https://get.venmo.com/TAS4TM6WmCb). Zelle is slightly less common outside international student circles, compared to Venmo which is more popular among Americans.
   - [PayPal is a popular way to send money in the US to people you don't quite trust](https://py.pl/2HQ9AX), and on many questionable sites, paying through PayPal prevents them from getting your card details.

9. **How do I send money to the US?**

   - The most stable option to remit money to the US is using wire transfers.
   - Wire transfers have fees in four possible ways:
     - Conversion fees: These are straightforward—a charge to convert your home currency to USD
     - Wire fees from your home country bank
     - Forex markup (i.e., the rate at which your currency is converted to USD); many services use poor rates
     - Incoming wire transfer fees from your bank in the US
   - You can minimize the first three by using newer banks with free international wires and good forex rates such as DBS, DCB, etc. (at least at the time of writing).
   - [Alternatively, you can try third party serives like Wise (formerly TransferWise) for international money transfers at better rates than banks offer](https://wise.com/invite/dic/akshaygurudatp)

10. **How do I pay my tuition and rent?**

- If your fees are being sent by your loan provider and they insist on paying the university directly, then Flywire and other services partnered with UCSD are your only options.
- If your bank disburses the amount to your account OR you are paying the fees yourself, then transfer the money to your bank account in the US and use the "E-Check" option to pay your fees. This costs merely 50 cents per transaction and is one of the easiest ways to pay UCSD.

11. **I don't have an SSN. How do I apply for a credit card in the US?**

    - The easiest approach is to open a credit card with the bank where you opened an account. Bank of America tends to do this immediately after opening an account, though Chase might make you wait a few months.
    - If you had a credit history in your home country, you have two other options: if you had an Amex credit card at home, you can apply for their Global Program, which can help you transition your existing card to the US.
    - Alternatively, you can simply apply for an Amex card and indicate that you don't have an SSN in the application. You'll be able to apply using the credit score from your home country.

## Transportation within San Diego

1. **How do I travel within San Diego?**

   - The main transportation options are MTS buses and Trolleys, which require the use of your "Pronto Pass." This will be activated at the start of the quarter; until then, you will need to load money onto the pass.

2. **How do I get to Nobel Drive?**
   - **Trolley**: For Nuevo East, South Mesa, Central Mesa, and Mesa Nueva residents, take the trolley at Executive Drive. For all other housing, take the trolley at VA Medical Center. From there, take the UCSD Blue Line Trolley toward San Ysidro to get to Nobel Drive Station.
   - **Buses**: You can also take buses including 101, 202, 41, etc., from various stops in and around Grad Housing.
   - **Walking**: It's a short 20-25 minute walk to Nobel Drive and usually fairly safe, at least during daylight hours. The Nobel Drive area itself is well-lit as shops are open until around 1 am.

## Groceries

1. **Where do most people get their groceries?**

   - **Target** - Available on campus, about a 25-minute walk from grad housing. Alternatively, you can take the Mesa South Shuttle, which takes 15 minutes; get off at Mandeville. _Best for: Milk, Eggs_
   - **Ralphs** - Nearest one is on Nobel Drive. You can walk there (takes around 25 minutes) or take the Blue Line (towards San Ysidro). Buses including 101, 30, etc., are also available. _Best for: Chicken, Veggies, Fruits, Alcohol_. Make sure to install their app for discounts—_otherwise, you'll pay full price for most items!_
   - **Trader Joe's** - Nearest one is on Nobel Drive. You can walk there (takes around 25 minutes) or take the Blue Line (towards San Ysidro). Buses including 101, 30, etc., are also available. _Best for: Frozen Food, specialty items_

2. **Where do I shop for Indian Groceries?**

   - **Miramar Cash and Carry**
   - **Namaste Plaza**
   - **Akshar Cash and Carry**

3. **These are too far. Can I order online?**

   - You can order online from most stores through their subscription services, such as Ralph's Boost, which costs $60 a year.
   - Miramar Cash and Carry offers home delivery for orders above $125. You can pool your order with others for this. _However, prices are 10-20% higher for delivery, and there is no student discount._

4. **I've heard about Costco. Where is the nearest location?**

   - The nearest one is in Morena; however, there's no public transportation that goes nearby.
   - Entry requires a membership of at least $60 a year, and groceries are sold in quantities most students won't use.
   - _Best for: Quality clothing at good prices, electronics, Brita Filters_

5. **I've heard about Walmart. Where is the nearest location?**
   - The nearest one is in Clairemont Mesa. You can take bus 41 and then switch to 43.
   - Alternatively, during weekends, there's the Grocery Shuttle that will take you directly to Walmart.
6. **I love fish. Where can I buy fresh fish?**
   - **99 Ranch Market** - On Convoy Street. You can take the aforementioned Grocery Shuttle on weekends, which stops right in front of it. Also sells Asian groceries like Boba packets, Ramen, etc.

## State ID and Driving License

1. **What is a State ID, and do I need one?**

   - A state ID is simply a document that serves as proof of your identity. It can be used to enter bars, take flights, prove you're a San Diego resident for discounted entry to the Zoo, etc.

2. **What is a REAL ID, and how does it differ from the State ID/DL?**
   - A REAL ID is like a chip-based version of the state ID or DL. You can have ONE, so you can either get a REAL ID DL or State ID. I recommend getting the State ID version, as it takes time to get a DL.
   - You'll need to use a REAL ID to take domestic flights in the US (otherwise, you need to carry your passport).
3. **What is the process to get a state ID and DL?**

   - There's a common form for both; you can apply for both at the same time. Go to the [DMV website](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/dl-id-online-app-edl-44/) and fill out the form.
   - You may need to upload documents such as two forms of address proof (rental agreement, bank account statement printout, and utility bills for OMS/Mesa Housing/off-campus residents work) along with immigration documents such as passport, visa, etc.
   - You can book an appointment or walk in, though the line for walking in will be longer. The nearest DMV is in Clairemont.
   - Bring all documents and wait in line for a token. Provide documents to the staff. If you've applied for a DL, you'll need to pass the multiple-choice test, which requires 32/40 correct answers.
   - If you pass the MCQ, you get a learner's permit, and then you can book a behind-the-wheel test within a year.

4. **Do I need an SSN?**

   - You do not need an SSN to get a state ID or a driver's license.
   - However, in some cases, the DMV may request that you provide an SSN rejection letter—a document from the SSA office stating that you're not eligible for an SSN.

5. **How much does it cost?**
   - At the time of writing - $35 for the State ID and $41 for a Class C DL.
   - Note that there are extra charges if you pay by card.
6. **How do I prepare for the test?**
   - Please [read the entire handbook a couple of times](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/california-driver-handbook-pdf/) for the written part of the test.
   - Practice the DMV route (available on YouTube) by renting a car.
7. **How do I get a car for the behind-the-wheel test?**

   - You'll need to rent a car from a rental company such as Hertz, Enterprise, etc., which needs to be insured in your name.
   - Depending on your circumstances, you might need someone with a valid California DL with you.

8. **How many attempts do I get?**
   - Three for the multiple-choice test and three for the behind-the-wheel test.

## Social Security Number

1. **Can international students get a social security number?**
   - International students are eligible for a social security number if they have some form of employment in the US. This can be an on-campus job, a TA or GSR position, an internship, etc.
2. **What is the process to get a social security number as a TA/GSR?**
   - Download and print your appointment letter from the Academic Affairs portal.
   - Contact your hiring department's HR and request an "offer letter." _This needs to be a WET INK_ letter, which means there's a physical signature on it using a pen.
   - Apply for a support letter from ISPO; this process takes a few business days.
   - Visit an SSA office with the above three letters along with your usual immigration documents. The nearest one to grad housing is in Little Italy. (Note: Google Maps recommends Kearny Mesa, but this requires two bus changes and is annoying to get to.)

## HDH and Housing Questions

1. **What is the difference between the mailing address and actual address?**

   - This question is mainly relevant for buildings with a separate mailroom, such as the Nuevas.
   - The mailing address is where most, if not all, mail and parcels should be addressed. This is the mailroom address where parcels will be collected. USPS-delivered letters will be put in your house's mailbox.
   - The actual house's address is different and is where you physically live. Doordash, Uber Eats, Instacart, etc., can be addressed to this address. _However, this is less reliable for certain buildings which require keycards to enter._

2. **What is the format of the housing address?**

   - For the Nuevas, the address is usually in the format: mailbox number, mailbox building number, Miramar Street, La Jolla, CA 92092
   - For the older Mesas, the address is usually in the format: house number Regents Road, Apt apartment name

3. **Can we switch houses later on?**

   - Yes, just fill out the housing application again.

4. **Can we quit before the two-year lease period is up?**

   - Yes, with one month's notice, you can leave.

5. **How is garbage and waste disposal handled?**

   - Buildings such as Mesa Nueva, Nuevo East, and Nuevo West have "trash chutes" where you can dispose of your garbage bags.
   - Other buildings have large bins in their area where garbage can be thrown. For both cases, you'll have a general landfill bin and a recyclable bin.
   - You'll need to purchase a trash can and appropriate garbage bags, such as these [13 gallon ones](https://amzn.to/3sbfZSF) or these [30 gallon ones](https://amzn.to/3qyioX1).

6. **Does HDH lend out any tools/services for free?**

   - **Vacuum Cleaner**: You can borrow a decently sized vacuum cleaner from HDH by collecting one from the mailrooms or HDH offices. There isn't any strict timeline to return them, but they'll usually make you sign a document asking for your flat number and PID.
   - **Tool Box**: You can borrow a toolkit with items like spanners from HDH by collecting one from the mailrooms or HDH offices. There isn't any strict timeline to return them, but they'll usually make you sign a document asking for your flat number and PID.
   - **Carts**: If you want to carry heavy items, HDH provides large carts that make it easy to transport beds, mattresses, and other heavy items.

7. **Can we have friends/family over to stay for a few days?**

   - As long as your flatmates and/or roommates are comfortable with it, it should be fine.
   - Just get a [sleeping bag](https://amzn.to/3OJdsGL) or a [cheap air mattress](https://amzn.to/3P39sm5) for them if you don't have a couch for them to crash on.

## Career Fairs

1. **How do career fairs work?**

   - Usually, companies set up booths where you can queue up and wait for your turn to talk to recruiters, current employees, or even hiring managers.
   - Generally, there isn't any specific thing you can/can't talk about. Naturally, you want to keep it professional and relevant, as these are busy individuals, but it's your responsibility to make a lasting impression.
   - If you're socially skilled and do your research, you may be able to convert that conversation into a future meeting where you can leverage the connection for a referral. _Do not ask for a referral on the spot—it's considered bad etiquette, and advisors generally hate that behavior._

2. **Are we guaranteed a job, or is there still uncertainty?**

   - Most companies that come to UCSD career fairs have long histories of hiring from UCSD. So while there isn't an Indian-style campus placement system, if a company comes to UCSD, it means they have a favorable impression of our graduates, have several alumni working there, and will likely favor UCSD grads.
   - Many companies have dedicated University Recruiters. These individuals are points of contact from the company for all students from the university. UCSD usually has a dedicated recruiter (sometimes shared with other UCs such as UCLA and Cal) with major firms. Stay in touch with these folks—they'll push to hire you and can provide you with resources.

3. **So even for campus fairs, we still just apply online?**

   - Usually, yes. However, many companies will have a _special link_ for the career fair itself. Attendees can apply through that, and occasionally, some companies will send an online assessment to all who applied through that link.
   - Also, bring physical copies of your resume to drop off. Some companies will reach out about open positions if you leave a resume.

4. **How should we dress?**

   - I'll defer to CSE's suggestion: "US business casual. You do not need a full suit, but DO NOT show up in dirty clothes, pajamas, sleepwear, or anything too casual. You need to see yourself through the employer's eyes—a sloppy image can suggest that you don't care about employment and can also be interpreted as arrogance."

## First Week Checklist

- Phone, if needed
- New SIM (have a senior collect a Mint SIM from ISPO)
- Get I-94 checked
- New laptop, if needed
- Apply for Real ID and/or learner's permit ASAP
- If unfurnished, furnish your place
- Groceries! Learn how the trolley works, how buses work, etc.
- Open a bank account (some banks even give you a credit card if you ask)
- Go to campus and figure out where your department is and where your classrooms are
- Make the customary Indian store trip to stock up on a 20lb bag of rice and chapatis
- Explore San Diego—you won't have much time for this later!

## Concluding Thoughts

This is a work-in-progress document that will need constant updates. Please reach out if you notice any errors or have suggestions for improvements.
