1. Ralphs
2. Target
3. Walmart

### Transportation

1. Uber
2. Lyft (Feel free to use the following referral codes: [click here for Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/i/AKSHAY37803?utm_medium=p2pi_iacc) or enter AKSHAY37803
3. ZipCar - Sign up early as they take a few days to approve your application
4. Kayak/Priceline - Use this to figure out the cheapest flight tickets. _Southwest flights are NOT present on these so check those out separately_
