<p><strong>How do I get from the San Diego Airport to the UCSD Campus?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uber</strong> - The easiest option to get from airport to the campus is obviously and Uber or a Lyft. Naturally, this is a pricier ofoption, regular ones start at around $20 and an XL during peak hours can almost reach $50.</li>
<li><strong>Airport Shuttle</strong> - This is available during the daylight hours and will take you to the Old Town Transit Centre. From there you can take the UCSD Blue Line Trolley to UTC to get to Grad Housing. For Nuevo East, South Mesa and Mesa Nueva residents please get down at Executive Drive and for all other housing please get down at VA Medical Center</li>
<li><strong>Car Rental</strong> - Strongly recommended that you take this option at your own risk as for most international students you will be jet lagged, tired and possibly not used to driving in the US and lastly the legality of driving in the US with an international driver's license is not entirely clear. Strictly for informational purposes, you can rent a car from the airport, there will be rental car companies such as Hertz, Enterprise, etc who will issue you a car for about $49-60 a day, fuel not included.
