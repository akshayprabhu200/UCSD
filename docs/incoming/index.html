<p><strong>Book a bank appointment!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#banking-in-the-us">More on banking in the banking section</a></li>
<li>Banks in the US will NOT entertain you without an appointment. Book an appointment for this while you are in India. This time is peak season to the point the Nobel Drive branch calls in twelve banks from other branches to handle the demand.</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Prepare for the learners license test</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A DL in the US is a very useful document to have, you will need to clear a DL learners license test.</li>
<li>Please <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/california-driver-handbook-pdf/">read the entire handbook a couple of times</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Travel Insurance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strictly speaking this is optional, however, Fall Quarter coverage for UCShip doesnt start till the start of the quarter so it is highly recommended to have some cover for your health.</li>
<li>Make sure to read about the coverage, some plans have incredibly poor travel coverage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prearrival Purchases</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For people landing early, or at odd times if you need certain &quot;small&quot; items as soon as you land, there's things called Amazon Lockers. These are open 24/7 and if you order to them, Amazon sends you a code, you enter the code on the Kiosk and it automatically opens the locker with your item which you can grab. Nearest ones: Nuevo East - Furniture, in the Exchange building; NW - Ruckus, under Viento; MN - Convex, no clue, forgot where this is lol; It will be available on the checkout page.</li>
<li>You may want to order certain things for day one itself, as shipping in the US take a lot more time than India so make sure to order some of this stuff in advance. You can sign up for <a href="https://amzn.to/3QtUOVV">Amazon Prime as a student for free for six months</a>. Make sure to take advantage of that</li>
<li>Some stuff you may want to order in advance before arriving here depending on your situation are: <a href="https://amzn.to/3YmXCWQ">bidet/jet spray</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3qqgqYO">toilet paper</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/47mgzNr">sunscreen</a> (yes, it's sunny here, even during the winter), <a href="https://amzn.to/3OMbYge">kitchen rolls</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3Qw2y9W">body wash</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3KA9rU5">dish soap</a>, etc. Other potential purhcases there on the <a href="https://ucsd.akshayprabhu.dev/purchases/">purchases page</a></li>

<p><strong>How do I get from the San Diego Airport to the UCSD Campus?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uber</strong> - The easiest option to get from airport to the campus is obviously and Uber or a Lyft (Feel free to use the following referral codes: <a href="https://www.lyft.com/i/AKSHAY37803?utm_medium=p2pi_iacc">click here for Lyft</a> or enter AKSHAY37803 for a discount on your rides. Uber doesn't have such a bonus currently). Naturally, this is a pricier option, regular ones start at around $20 and an XL during peak hours can almost reach $50.</li>
<li><strong>Airport Shuttle</strong> - This is available during the daylight hours and will take you to the Old Town Transit Centre. From there you can take the UCSD Blue Line Trolley to UTC to get to Grad Housing. For Nuevo East, South Mesa and Mesa Nueva residents please get down at Executive Drive and for all other housing please get down at VA Medical Center</li>
<li><strong>Car Rental</strong> - Strongly recommended that you take this option at your own risk as for most international students you will be jet lagged, tired and possibly not used to driving in the US and lastly the legality of driving in the US with an international driver's license is not entirely clear. Strictly for informational purposes, you can rent a car from the airport, there will be rental car companies such as Hertz, Enterprise, etc who will issue you a car for about $49-60 a day, fuel not included.

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I have heard about Costco, where is the nearest Costco?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nearest one is in Morena, however there is no public transportation that goes closeby.</li>
<li>Entry needs a membership of atleast $60 a year and the groceries are sold in quantities most students wont use.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>

<h2 id="state-id-and-driving-license" tabindex="-1">State ID and Driving License<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#state-id-and-driving-license" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>What is a State ID and do I need one?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A state ID is simply a document that acts as a proof of your identity. It can used to enter bars, take flights, prove you are a San Diego resident for discounted entry to the Zoo, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is a REAL ID and how does it differ from the State ID/DL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>REAL ID is like a chip based version of the state ID or DL. You can have ONE so you can either get a REAL ID DL or State ID. I would recommend getting the State ID version as it takes time to get a DL</li>
<li>You would need to use a REAL ID take domestic flights in the US (otherwise you need to carry your passport).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the process to get a state ID and DL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Same common form for both, you can apply for both at the same time. Go to <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/dl-id-online-app-edl-44/">DMV website</a> and fill out the form</li>
<li>You may need to upload some documents such as two forms of address proof (rental agreement, bank account statement print out and utility bills for OMS/Mesa Housing/off campus residents works) along site immigration documents such as passport, visa, etc.</li>
<li>You can book an appointment or you can walk in, however the line for walking in will be longer. The nearest DMV is in Clairemont.</li>
<li>Carry all documents, wait in line for a token. Provide documents to the staff. If you have signed up for a DL, you will need to clear the MCQ test too, which required 32/40 correct.</li>
<li>If you clear the MCQ, you get a learners license and then you can book a behind the wheel test within a year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do I need an SSN?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You do not need an SSN to get a state ID or a drivers license.</li>
<li>However, in some cases the DMV may request you provide an SSN rejection letter which is a document from the SSA office that states that you are not eligible for an SSN.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How much are the costs?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At the time of writing this article - 35$ for the State ID and 41$ for a class C DL</li>
<li>Do note there are extra charges if you pay by card.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How to prepare for the test?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Please <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/california-driver-handbook-pdf/">read the entire handbook a couple of times</a> for the first part of the test.</li>
<li>Practice the DMV route (availabe on youtube) by renting a car.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How to get a car for the behind the wheel test?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You will need to rent a car from a rental car company such as Hertz, Enterprise, etc which needs to insured in your name.</li>
<li>Depending on your circumstances you might need someone with a valid California DL with you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How many attempts do I get?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Three for the MCQ based test and three for the behind the wheel test.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="social-security-number" tabindex="-1">Social Security Number<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#social-security-number" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Can international students get a social security number?</strong>
<ul>
<li>International students are eligible for a social security number if they have get some form of employment in the US. This can be an on campus job, a TA or GSR position, an internship, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What is the process to get a social security number as TA/GSR?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Download and print your appointment letter from the Academic Affairs portal</li>
<li>Contact your hiring department's HR and request for an &quot;offer letter&quot;. <em>This needs to be a WET INK</em> letter, which means there's a physical sign on it using a pen.</li>
<li>Apply for a support letter from ISPO, this process takes a few business days.</li>
<li>Visit an SSA office with the above three letters along with your usual immigration documents. Nearest one to grad housing is in Little Italy (Note: Google Maps recommends Kearny Mesa but this requires two bus changes and is annoying to get to.)</li>
</ul>
